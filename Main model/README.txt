To make the model the following steps were followed:
-Models were trained using Train_base_model.py
-Predict.py was used to make prediction of the model to make training of the machine learning models more convenient
-Ensemble models were trained using Train_RF.py and Train_SVM.py
-All models were loaded in with Load_model.py to compare the train and validation AUC scores
-Kaggle_submission.py is used to submit the models to kaggle

The folder models contains all models used in predicting and combining
The folder predictions contains all premade predictions
